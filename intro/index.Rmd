This project illustrates using RStudio Connect to deploy a data science project featuring:

### Scheduled jobs

- Fetching and cleaning data from a continuously updating web source
- Pushing cleaned data to a relational database
- Creating intermediate datasets for subsequent use

### Pins

- Serving intermediate datasets and model objects for use in apps, APIs, and other jobs

### APIs

- Serving model predictions via HTTP requests

### Development and Production Apps
  
- Exposing model predictions to end-users through Shiny and Dash apps
- Using git-backed deployment to keep a stable version of the application available from the main branch while doing development work on another branch

### Private Packages

- Encapsulate re-usable logic in an R package, and distribute with Package Manager
